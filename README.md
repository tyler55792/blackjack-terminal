# blackjack-terminal

This was my first personal python coding project! 
Tired of losing money in real blackjack, so I wrote a python script that would allow me to play with fake money from the terminal.

Ignore the lack of modularity, lack of input validation, use of global variables, inconsistent formatting, and bloated main(). I've come a long way since I wrote this!
